# Political support study

## Overview

This repo provides how to reproduce my work on the "Analyzing Demographic and Socioeconomic Characteristics of Biden Voters in the 2020 US Presidential Election"


## Statement on LLM usage


Aspects of the code were written with the help of the autocomplete tool, OPENAI chatGPT 3.5. I asked for some Demographic and Socioeconomic Characteristics in United States. For example, the proportion of White people in United States. Why Biden is supported by women and high education voters, etc. I also asked ChatGPT to give me a good title for this paper. The entire chat history is available in inputs/llms/usage.txt.


This repo provides you with a foundation to reproduce the results.
